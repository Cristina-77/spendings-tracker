                <h2>Advice for budgeting:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Setting up a budget means setting an amount of money you can spend each week, sure. But we like to be realistic over here. Because starting a budget at the beginning of the week is all well and good, until you get to 48 hours free time at the weekend, have loads of fun plans in the diary and realise that you’ve got $4.71 to cover everything. That’s why it’s a wise idea to set a budget for mid-week fun and weekend fun. Because the truth is, you deserve to have fun! That’s why we live by our <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp">50/30/20 rule</a>, which allocates 30% of your income to fun each week. </li>
                    <li>We all have dozens of transactions coming out of our bank account every month, but a successful budget is one which weeds out the unnecessaries. Start off by looking through your<a href="category-graphs.html"> bank balance</a> to see if there are any unnecessary monthly costs going out, such as a magazine subscription you no longer use. Maybe it’s just one extra luxury you don’t need. Cut them out, have yourself the cash and if you can, direct the savings towards your investments. </li>
                    <li>Ever feel like you buy things without really wanting or needing them but simply because they’re the latest thing you saw whilst scrolling on Instagram or because it was in the sale? Next time you feel like you want something, add it to a wish list. The simple act of writing it down will already require it to have some level of validation and want rather than being a whim. If it’s still on your wish list a month later, you’re clearly wanting this and can consider making the purchase, without the impulse spending.
